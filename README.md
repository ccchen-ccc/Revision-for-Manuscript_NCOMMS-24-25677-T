# Massively-parallel-variant-to-function-mapping-determines-regulatory-functional-variants-of-NSCLC
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project titled "Massively parallel variant-to-function mapping determines regulatory functional variants of non-small cell lung cancer." This project focuses on identifying and understanding the regulatory functional variants associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using MPRA and advanced computational techniques.

Data and code for files are organized in the data/ directory.
